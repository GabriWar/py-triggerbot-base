# Fast-Valorant-Triggerbot
By far the fastest available python triggerbot out there, no joke its speed is pretty crazy.

# About it
Reaction time is equivalent to your refresh rate, during testing I measured around 2-10ms reaction time,
which is extremely fast for a python triggerbot. This Triggerbot can be used with any hotkey you'd like,
just go into config.json and replace trigger_hotkey with any virtual key code, you can find them here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes


# How to setup
- If you you're a coder, you can use the source, if not please proceed to use the exe.
- Start Exe, Start Valorant, go to ingame settings and use purple outline.
- While being in ingame settings go to keybinds and add K as a second shoot keybind.
- By default  shift is the hotkey, if you have always enabled turn on, use f10 instead.
- Should work

- Additionally you can change the color tolerance, I recommend 20-70, also a delay can be added, => config.json

# FAQ
Can I get banned using this?
- there is always a risk but its very unlikely, i'd recommend compiling the source by yourself though and maybe adding vmp to it

How to make it faster?
- this is already pretty fast but if you'd wish to make it faster you can add DXCAM to it and maybe multithreading, these are the only ways I can think of to make it even faster, additionally this in any native language would be a lot faster already.

Why release this?
- why not


PS: Exe is compiled with nuitka!!!
